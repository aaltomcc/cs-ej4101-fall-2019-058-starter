# About
Hi, my name is Sampo Paukkonen and I'm currently in my second year of studies toward a bachelor's in Computer Science at Aalto University.  
I decided to study Computer Science because in my opinion it gives you the best skill set to impact modern society, regardless of what you niche is nor what you want to accomplish.
Specifically, Computer Science is an excellent choice for anyone who likes to solve problems of any kind be it a hard max flow problem or reducing companies expenses with more efficient manners.  
During my studies so far I've fallen in love with the mathematics involved in computer science; optimization, graph theory, number theory and in general, discrete mathematics.
As a consequence, I'm currently planning to direct my master's more towards applied mathematics and operations research.
