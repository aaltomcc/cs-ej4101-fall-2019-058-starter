# This course
I decided to take this course to gain a better understanding of DevOps as a whole.
Well build testing infrastuctures are nothing if the persons writing the software are not fully committed to using them. This can be helped by better incorporating the desired aspects to the company's working culture and this, specifially, was what I wanted to learn from this course; to fully ingrain, or at minimum to gain a direction to, the culture of DevOps.
I acquired an interest to testing while I was working as a summer inter in Nokia, where I was tasked with upgrading and maintaining used python testing libraries. My job experience gave me the opportunity to learn the how, but
I was still lacking the why, at a company level, until one of my friends recommended this course to me.

My initial expectations were to only learn a small scratch about DevOps, as this course happends to be only one ECTS credit; some basic terminology and maybe a few flow diagrams. But I was positively surprised to found out that
the course material did a good job resonating the why in an intuitive way even with only a few stories. Learning and understanding the culture aspect of CAMS was, in my opion, the best part about this course.

So it is said that I had only a vague idea of what I was going to learn, something about the general usage of DevOps, the why and whatnot. And I would have been satisfied with just that.
But, the course did me a favor again by giving me an excellent opportunity to learn both markup language and githug pages. This will give me something to tinker with during my Christmas brake as I never thought that building your own sites would have been this easy. Yes sure, you could always build and React applications in just a few minutes, but by using gh pages you can build your own CV with a style in under 30 minutes.
