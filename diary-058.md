# This course
I decided to take this course to gain a better understanding of DevOps as a whole.
Well build testing infrastuctures are nothing if the people behind the software are not fully committed to using them. This can be helped by better incorporating the desired aspects to the company's working culture and this, specifially, was what I wanted to learn from this course; to fully ingrain, or at minimum to gain a direction to, the culture of DevOps.
I acquired an interest to testing while I was working as a summer inter in Nokia, where I was tasked with upgrading and maintaining used python testing libraries. My job experience gave me the opportunity to learn the how, but
I was still lacking the why, at a company level, until one of my friends recommended this course to me.

My initial expectations were to only learn a small scratch about DevOps, as this course happends to be only one ECTS credit; some basic terminology and maybe a few flow diagrams. But I was positively surprised to found out that
the course material did a good job resonating the why in an intuitive way even with only a few stories. Learning and understanding the culture aspect of CAMS was, in my opion, the best part about this course.

So it is said that I had only a vague idea of what I was going to learn, something about the general usage of DevOps, the why and whatnot. And I would have been satisfied with just that.
But, the course did me a favor again by giving me an excellent opportunity to learn both markup language and githug pages. This will give me something to tinker with during my Christmas brake as I never thought that building your own sites would have been this easy. Yes sure, you could always build and React applications in just a few minutes, but by using gh pages you can build your own CV with a style in under 30 minutes.

# Learned

Aside what I said above about learning the tools used in this course, the main yield has been the knowledge about the DevOps itself.

Namely, that the working **_culture_** of the company is maybe the most important aspect of the **_CAMS_** model, which refers to the main set of values used by DevOps engineers everywhere. The culture is such an important aspect because it's essentially what is ingrained to the engineers. It's everything from the way the engineer team approaches a new problem to the small, yet important, decisions the engineers make on their own. And the best part about the culture is that it can be shared and learned! It's not something that you either have or don't have, it's a reflection of the choices and activities you, the engineer, does every day. And the surrounding organization can support this growth by encouraging culture of experimentation where failure is seen as a necessary step to learn, to better yourself, rather than a dire event which you should avoid at all cost - there's still a time and place for extra secure work.

Even though  the culture is a big aspect, there's still the A, M and S of the **CAMS** model, which refer to **Automation**, **Measurement** and **Sharing**, which form yet another important dimension in DevOps. Namely, automating menial and repetitive tasks both increase product quality as it frees resources elsewhere and consequently lowers to general expenses.
Automation also plays a great role in the measurement, where data is collected from the process and work flow in order to detect and fix problems early and to give reference material of the things which can be improved, cf. Feedback Loops.
The last part of the **CAMS** model is the sharing, which aims to improve visibility and transparency in order to eliminate information missmatch and to futher improve knowledge transfering within the company.
